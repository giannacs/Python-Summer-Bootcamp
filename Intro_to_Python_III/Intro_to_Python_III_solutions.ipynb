    "### Creating a Module with a Function and Class definitions\n",
    "1. Create a module with the following entities\n",
    "   * A function called **'demographics'** to asks a user for their firts name, last name and year of birth and returns these values in that order.<br>\n",
    "     NB: Remember the **input( )** or **raw_iput( )** functions for Python 3 and 2 respectively.\n",
    "   * A fuction called **'uc_6_2'** with two string inputs (two names of a person with the firt name as first input). This fuction returns the UC 6+2\n",
    "   * A class called **'Student'** with the following attributes\n",
    "     * Takes three string input(First name, last name, and year of birth in that order) to create an object of this class\n",
    "     * A **'student_count'** CLASS VARIABLE to track the count of every student object created so to use them in creating a student number for each student\n",
    "     * A method called **'student_number'** to return the student number. A student number is the **student's yeaar of birth** + **student's count**\n",
    "     * A method called **'student_id'** calls the **'uc_6_2'** function to return the student ID\n",
    "   * Save the module as **'uc_student.py'**\n",
    "<br><br>  \n",
    "2. Imports the uc_student.py module into your session\n",
    "   * Create 3 student objects using the following steps\n",
    "     * For each student call the **'demographics( )'** function as save the output in a variable\n",
    "     * Use the information provided to create a student object\n",
    "   * Print the student number and student id of each student object\n",
    "   * Print the total nubmber of students\n",
